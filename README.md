# skript-utils

An ever-expanding library of Skript utilities, all packaged into one file with only the utilities you use.

# TODO

- make the code nicer
- add more utilities
- ~~make it globally usable~~
- fix uses parsing errors
  - particularly in-string function calls like "%Time_durationBetweenUnix({_serverStartUnix}, getUnix())%" that don't work!!!
